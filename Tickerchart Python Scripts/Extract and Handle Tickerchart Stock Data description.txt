 This script is designed to preprocess and standardize daily TickerChart market data for flow-based analysis. It reads raw CSV data exported from the TickerChart platform, cleans and normalizes inflow and outflow metrics, enriches the dataset with metadata, and exports the processed data in a structured and analysis-ready format.

The workflow begins by loading the source file using a specified encoding to ensure compatibility with non-UTF characters. A predefined subset of relevant market and flow-related columns is selected to maintain consistency and eliminate unnecessary data.

Flow-related fields that may contain non-numeric placeholders (such as “-”) are systematically cleaned by:

Replacing missing or placeholder values with zero,

Removing thousands separators,

Converting all values to numeric (float) format.

This guarantees data integrity and prevents downstream calculation or ingestion errors.

The script then appends a standardized suffix to each instrument symbol to indicate flow-based data and injects the current processing date as a new column. Column ordering is enforced to match downstream system requirements and ensure schema consistency.

Finally, the cleaned and structured dataset is exported as a date-stamped CSV file to one or more predefined output directories, enabling seamless integration with analytics pipelines, reporting tools, or automated import systems.

The implementation emphasizes clarity, maintainability, and reproducibility while preserving the original business logic and output structure.
